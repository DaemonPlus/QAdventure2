# QAdventure2
Text based adventure game written in C.

# Your quest is to defeat the dark prince, and acquire the crown
You will face hardships, and will be defeated many times, but none are too difficult for an adventurer like you.

# IT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DRAW A MAP AS YOU PLAY WITH PEN AND PAPER
This'll do for now. I'm planning to implement an in-game `map` feature but fuck off I'll do that later

# WINDOWS USERS:
